Declaring New and Modified 3rd Party IP
=============================================

**THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY SERVING AS A PLACEHOLDER.  IN PROGRESS for updates.**

**Purpose**: In normal day-to-day development of code, engineers are often exposed to 3rd party intellectual property (IP).  When adding or modifying 3rd party IP certain steps must be followed to ensure the actions comply with Wind River's global IP policy and product line specific IP policies.  This document outlines some of the important steps related to 3rd party IP and where to find resources.
