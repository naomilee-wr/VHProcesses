Continuous Improvement Processes
======================================

Corrective and Preventive Action **WIP**
-----------------------------------------

This process is used to establish and define the process for identifying, documenting, analyzing and implementing corrective actions in order to eliminate the problem (e.g., noncompliance/defect).

Corrective action: Upon detection of a problem, action taken to correct the direct cause and to prevent recurrence.

Preventive actions are proactive measures implemented when there is a risk for a potential process deviation/noncompliance.

QMS Management and Maintenance **WIP**
--------------------------------------

Senior management along with the key stakeholders will continually improve the effectiveness of the Quality Management System (QMS), and review the quality policy and the QMS objectives for continued suitability on an as needed/annual basis to ensure its continued effectiveness.

The QMS is updated after analyzing the process improvement requests received and an updated version of the QMS is releases. This process describes how process assets in the QMS are managed and controlled. All policies, processes, procedures, guidelines, standards and templates in the QMS are kept under the CM system.
