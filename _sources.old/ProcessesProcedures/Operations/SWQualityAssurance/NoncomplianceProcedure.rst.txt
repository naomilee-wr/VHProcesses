============================
Noncompliance Procedure
============================

**THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY SERVING AS A PLACEHOLDER.  IN PROGRESS for updates.**

This process describes how noncompliances resulting from internal audits are managed. 

The Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and Configuration Management (CM) Lead is responsible for this process. The SQA/CM Lead may designate another person to perform the noncompliance process. 

The Key Stakeholders (e.g., Engineering Managers/Director, Engineering Program Manager (EPM), Technical Lead, Test Lead, noncompliance owner) participate in this process.  Noncompliance owners can be anyone and the owners are responsible for resolving noncompliances.

| **Entry Criteria**                   | An audit finds a noncompliance       |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| **Inputs**                           | Audit Record in Audit Tool           |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| **Exit Criteria**                    | The Noncompliance Record is closed.  |
|                                      | The noncompliance was either fixed,  |
|                                      | determined not to fix, withdrawn     |
|                                      | because it was not valid.            |

   * - Step #
     - Activity Name
     - Description
    
   * - 1
     - Submit Noncompliance Record
     - In the Audit Tool, the Auditor creates a new Noncompliance Record.  Link the Noncompliance to the audit record.  Set the severity:  
	 
       -  Minor: The noncompliance minimally impacts the program and does not impact the quality of the product.
	 
       -  Major: The noncompliance could potentially have significant impact on the program or product quality. 

       *Note:* Observations (opportunities for improvement) are evidence of weak practices (not of significant concern) which if not addressed could result in a future nonconformity.       
    
   * - 2
     - Review Noncompliance Record
     - Discuss the noncompliance with Key Stakeholders. Determine if it is a valid problem. 
    
   * - 3
     - Noncompliance withdrawn
     - If the noncompliance is not valid, set the resolution to withdrawn and provide an explanation in the Comments. 

   * - 4
     - Approve "won't fix"
     - If the noncompliance is valid, but cannot address it, set the Resolution to Won't Fix. 

       If the Key Stakeholders (e.g., Engineering Managers/Director, Engineering Program Manager (EPM), Technical Lead, Test Lead) approve not fixing the issue, provide an explanation in the comments and close the noncompliance.  

       If the Key Stakeholders do not approve, then the noncompliance must be addressed. 

   * - 5
     - Assign owner
     - The Key Stakeholders (e.g., Engineering Managers/Director, Engineering Program Manager (EPM), Technical Lead, Test Lead) discuss and assign an Owner to fix the noncompliance. 

   * - 6
     - Determine cause and identify corrective action
     - If the noncompliance is valid and the Owner will fix it, discuss the corrective action with the Owner and describe the corrective action plan. Agree on a date for completion with the Owner and fill in the Due Date. 

   * - 7
     - Implement corrective action
     - If the Owner completes the action, the Auditor verifies the fix. If the action is not completed, the Auditor/SQA or CM Lead decides to escalate the issue. 

   * - 8
     - Escalate noncompliance
     - If the Owner fails to carry out the corrective action, the Auditor/SQA or CM Lead and Owner attempt to reach an agreement on when the action will be completed.  

       If an agreement is reached, it is documented in the Noncompliance Record.  

       If an agreement is not reached, the Auditor/SQA or CM Lead escalates the noncompliance to the Key Stakeholders (e.g., Engineering Manager, Engineering Program Manager (EPM), Technical Lead, Test Lead). 

   * - 9
     - Resolve escalation
     - The Key Stakeholders (e.g., Engineering Manager, Engineering Program Manager (EPM), Technical Lead, Test Lead) work with the Owner or Owner's manager to resolve the escalation. 

   * - 10
     - Verify fix
     - When the Owner completes the fix, the Auditor verifies the fix addresses the noncompliance. The Auditor enters what is done to verify the fix.  

       If the action repairs the problem, the Auditor sets the Noncompliance resolution to fixed.  

       If the fix does not fully address the noncompliance, the auditor and Owner revise the corrective action and the noncompliance remains open. 

   * - 11
     - Noncompliance closed
     - The Auditor sets the status to closed when the resolution:
	 
       -  is withdrawn,  
	 
       -  is won't fix and the EPM has approved not fixing the issue, or 
	 
       -  is fixed. 

   * - 12
     - Report status
     - Progress against noncompliances is reported periodically to the EPM.
