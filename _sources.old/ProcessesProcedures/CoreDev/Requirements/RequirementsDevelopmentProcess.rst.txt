Requirements Development Process 
================================


The process describes the development of software requirements from customer requirements (i.e., Epics from Market Segment and Product Management).

|

The Product Architect is responsible for this process.

|

+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Entry Criteria/Inputs**   | - Customer/Product Requirements have been gathered.                       |
|                            | - Product Backlog (Epic backlog) is created in the Requirement Management |
|                            |    system (e.g., Jira Agile)                                              |
+----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Exit Criteria/Outputs**   | - Software requirements are identified as Epics(Features)are reviewed     |
|                            |   (prioritized)in the Requirement Management System (e.g., Jira Agile)    |
|                            | - Product Architect investigates and captures implementation decisions    |
|                            |   (if applicable)                                                         |
|                            | - Software Requirements are ready for development and committed           |
|                            |   for the release                                                         |
|                            | - Snapshot of the software requirements (Epics) as part of the Plan Of    |
|                            |   Record (POR) or Plan of Intent (POI) Milestone                          |

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Step #
     - Activity Name
     - Description

   * - 1
     - Evaluate customer requirements (i.e., Epics from market segment and product management)
     - The Product Manager documents the customer requirements in the Requirements Management system (e.g., Jira Agile) as Epics.

       The Product Architect evaluates customer requirements from market segment and product management.  The evaluation is performed collaboratively with Product Manager to to ensure a mutual understanding of the customer/product requirements.  This may result in further breakdown of Epics into sub-Epics to deal with larger scope items.  

   * - 2
     - Execute Prototype (if applicable)
     - The Product Architect may require a prototype be developed to explore possible implementations of the customer requirements.
 	 
   * - 3
     - Convert customer requirements to software requirements (i.e., development team stories and tasks)
     - The Product Architect reviews and refines the customer requirements and also identifies the security related requirements. Security related requirements are marked as TBD <Check with Martin/Kitty/Roger>

       Customer requirements are converted into software requirements (including security related requirements) into the Requirements Management System as Stories including development, testing and documentation Stories. See `Story Process <../../../Operations/ProgramManagement/StoryProcess.html>`__.   
	   
	   The breakdown of requirements also occur iteratively throughout the development lifecycle of the Epic.  This activity may also occur as part of a Scrum Team's regular grooming activities.
	   	   
   * - 4 
     - Trace between requirements
     - The Product Architect or Scrum Team maintains a traceability between software and customer requirements.  Software requirements are captured as Stories and/or stated broadly in the Epic’s description.

       The Product Architects are responsible to see that traceability between customer requirements and software requirements, and the hierarchy of requirements is maintained. 
     
   * - 5
     - Review requirements
     - The Product Architect reviews the set of requirements.
       The software requirements(Epics)are reviewed:

       - against Requirements Standard to assure Epics and Stories are well formed   ?? <Check with Martin/Kitty>
       - to assure traceability between software and customer requirements
       - to assure dependencies with other stakeholders have been identified
       - to assure a preliminary estimate (i.e. costing) has been communicated to Key Stakeholders

       Any outputs deemed incomplete are sent back for refinement. 

   * - 6 
     - Commit requirements
     - After review of the requirements, the Development Manager agrees that the Epic is ready for development.  The Development Manager identifies Scrum Teams that own the commitment and ensures an adequate staffing plan is available to deliver on the commitment.  The commitment is made in collaboration with the identified Scrum Team and the Technical Feature Owner.  
	   
       The set of requirements (Epics) is committed for the release it will be completed in.  Any changes to the committed Epics will be managed according to `Requirements Management Procedure <./RequirementsManagementProcedure.html>`__ 
	   
       The Scrum team further breaks down the Epics into Stories.  The Technical Feature Owner/Scrum Team follows the `Code Development Process <../CodingIntBuild/CodeDevelopmentProcess.html>`__. 
	   
       A snapshot of the requirements (from the Requirements Management System) is created at the start of the release as part of the Plan Of Record (POR) or Plan of Intent (POI) milestone and attached to the Release Documentation Repository (e.g., Jive)
