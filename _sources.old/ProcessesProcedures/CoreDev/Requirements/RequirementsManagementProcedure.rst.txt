**Requirements Management Procedure**
=====================================

This procedure describes the how changes to the committed requirements that constitute the committed set of Epics are managed and tracked to closure.

The Engineering Manager is responsibile for initiating and the Engineering Program Manager is responsible for executing this procedure.

**Steps**
---------

1. **Identify change**

   Anyone may file a Change Request when a change is proposed to the committed set of requirements.
	 
   - For changes to committed set of requirements, create a Program Change Request (PCR) in Change Management system (e.g., Panorama, Jira). The Tools and Templates section below describes the change request fields. The Summary (should mention the Requirement ID), Priority, Performer, and Due Date fields are mandatory. The Description field should include the change impact analysis. The descriptions of the change request fields are in the Tools and Templates section below.
  
   - Changes to software requirements (less impact on the customer) will be tracked and managed by the Technical Feature Owner within the user stories in Requirements Management system (e.g., Jira Agile). No formal change request will be created. Change description and impacted details are documented in the story's comment section in Requirements Management system. 

2. **Evaluate change**

   - The Key Stakeholders (e.g., Product Manager, Engineering Manager, Technical Feature Owner, Scrum Team) review the impact assessment of the change to the committed set of requirements and decide on the change request.  
     If the stakeholders agree to proceed on the change, they mark their approval in the PCR that resides in the Requirements Management System.  The EPM marks the status = "Approved". The results of the review are captured in the "Description" field. Other Stakeholders who should be notified that the change has been accepted are added to the Approvals list.

   - In the scrum meeting, the Key Stakeholders review the impact assessment of the change to the software requirements and decide on the change request. 
     If the stakeholders agree to proceed on the change, the Technical Feature Owner captures the decision in the story's comment section in the Requirements Management System.  Scrum Master summarizes all changes to the Sprint user story in the End of Sprint Review meeting minutes.

   For change requests that are not approved, the stakeholders mark their disapproval in the Program Change Request that resides in the Requirements Management System.  

3. **Implement change**

   If the change request is approved, update Epic/Story/Tasks in Requirements Management System (e.g., Jira Agile) and other approved artifacts (HLD (if any), Test cases) as applicable. All modified program artifacts/work products will be reviewed, approved and committed.

4. **Accept change**

   If the Key Stakeholders agree that the change has been implemented and all artifacts associated with the change updated, the EPM sets the status = "Accepted" according to `Program Change Management Procedure Using Jira <../../Operations/ProgramManagement/ProgramChangeManagementProcedure_Jira.html>`__
