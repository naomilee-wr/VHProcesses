Design
-------
   
The process describes a sequence of activities performed to develop/manage design artifacts (Architecture Design, High Level Design, Low level Design) as applicable.

The Product Architect is responsible for executing this process.

Coding, Integration, and Build
-------------------------------

The Coding, Integration, and Build process describes a sequence of activities performed to develop, integrate and build software code.

The Developer is responsible for executing the Coding & Integration process and Build and Configuration Lead is responsible for executing the Build process.

Verification 
-------------
The process describes a sequence of activities performed to test software code.

The Software Tester is responsible for this process.

Validation 
------------
The process describes a sequence of activities performed to validate the software requirements.  Validation activities include reviewing each desired product Epics (committed to the release) against the acceptance criteria. The goal of this process is to confirm that the product meets the defined requirements and its acceptance criteria.

The Validator (e.g., Product Architect/Technical Feature Owner) is responsible for this process.
