=================================================== 
Technical Feature Owner - Cheat Sheet
===================================================

| 

**Purpose**
-----------

This document provides a quick-and-easy recipe for the Technical Feature Owner to follow when they are managing their Features/Epics in Jira Agile.  It is not meant as a documentation replacement, this is only a quick reference.

Once assigned a Feature/Epic, start by finding it in Jira Agile.  The following cheat sheet applies to all Features/Epics in the “VxWorks Program Project”.  If your Feature is not in this project then the process does not apply.
 
The following checkboxes provide guidelines on what to do next, based on your Feature/Epic’s current state:

- **Selected for Development**

  - Populated the "Scrum Team" field with the Scrum Team name
  - Specify "Technical Feature Owner" 
  - Ensure there is a “PA Owner” (i.e. architect)
  - Discuss the Feature/Epic with the PA Owner
  
    - Follow-up work may be required (e.g. proof-of-concept, HLD, etc.)

  - Ensure the “PA-Owner” has set the ‘PA-Tracking’ field
  
    - *Only the ‘PA-Owner’ shall set this field*

  - Provide a “Preliminary Estimate” (i.e. SWAG)
  
    - XS 6-weeks
    - S 12-weeks
    - M 24-weeks
    - L 48-weeks
    - XL 96-weeks

  - Ensure the “Release” has been set
  
    - Release needs to be committed to by the team
      
      - This is an indication that the EPIC is committed, is performed by setting the “Committed Version:” field in Jira.

  - Provide a “Refined Estimate” in total man-weeks (from start to finish)
  - *Once the team has agreed with their Development Manager, transition the Feature/Epic to In Progress*
	
  - **In Progress**
  
    - Ensure all User Stories are meeting the Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria 
    - Ensure a Test Plan has been written, review, and posted on Jive.  If applicable, not all EPICs require test plans or  LTAF results. 
    - Ensure Test Results are uploaded to LTAF, and test link is added in Jira as well
	
  - **Done**
    - Work with the PA Owner and the Scrum team to ensure the Epic's Definition of Done is met.
