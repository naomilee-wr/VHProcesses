========================================
Getting Started
========================================

The purpose of this document is to give a guide to how to navigate the documentation, how to report changes, how to make changes.

File Structure
==============

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 100
   :header-rows: 1   
   
      
   * - Directory
     - Description
  
   * - Flow Charts
     - VSB files
  
   * - GenericPlans
     - .rst files for GenericPlans
  
   * - ProcessDocuments
     - All .docx, .xlsx files.  Copy this folder manually into _build/html when any changes are made.
  
   * - ProcessesProcedures
     - .rst files for Processes and Procedures
  
   * - SupplementartyGuidelines
     - .rst files for Supplementary Guidelines
  
   * - docs
     - Copy of _build/html folder used for publishing on github
  
   * - _static
     - .jpg files related to processes, procedures and supplementary guidelines.  Gets automatically copied over to _build/html file when running make
  
   * - _build
     - directory with html files generated by sphinx

Tips
~~~~~~

#.  Copy ProcessDocuments as a subfolder into _build/html folder whenever changes are made:

.. |image0| image:: ../../../_static/GettingStarted/htmlfolder.jpg

#.  Keep Visio files in FlowCharts, but save any derived jpgs into _static folder

#.  Do not copy individual files directly into the _build folder that are not in other folders (such as _static or ProcessDocuments).  This folder will get cleared out when running “make clean”
