=========================================
Creating Feature Test Plan Guideline
=========================================
|
|

**Purpose**
------------

For every Feature/Epic that a team will be releasing, a test plan must be authored, reviewed and accepted.  A test plan can cover more than one Feature/Epic.

**Important References**
-------------------------

- `Test Process Guideline <./TestProcessGuideline.html>`__
- `Feature Test Plan Template <./FeatureTestPlanTemplate.docx>`__

|
 
**Guidelines**
--------------
 
- Feature Test Plan must identify/include the following:
  
  - test environment
  - risks and dependencies
  - test cases that need to be created
  - existing test cases that should be rerun before code submission.
  - impact on other areas, e.g. performance, footprint, etc. to ensure these are checked.
  - test results location
  - defects related to the feature
  

- It's important to note that:

  - Feature Test Plans must be reviewed the Feature Architect (Product Architect) and the Lead Feature Developer (unless the Lead is the author).
  - Feature Test Plans must be uploaded before the Feature/Epic's merge date.
  - All automated feature/epic tests should be added into nightly regression Suite.
