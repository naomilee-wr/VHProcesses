========================
Documenting a Feature
========================

**THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY SERVING AS A PLACEHOLDER.  IN PROGRESS for updates.**

**Purpose:** In most cases, new Features will require some amount of customer documentation.  The following page provides some guidelines on how best to proceed in providing this documentation in collaboration with the InfoDev Team.

(Source: https://jive.windriver.com/docs/DOC-63398)

**Procedure:**
----------------
- As soon as the Technical Feature Owner (TFO) is aware that their Feature will require documentation changes, they should contact their InfoDev author and make them aware of the requirement

  - If the TFO does not know who is their designated author, they should contact brian.kuhl@windriver.com
 
- Once the requirement has been communicated to an author, the team should negotiate when and how they will communicate their updates

  - The traditional documentation process called for 3 User Stories to be added to Features:
   
    1. Engineering provides InfoDev with a readme
    2. InfoDev authors the documentation
    3. Engineering reviews the documentation

  - Doc as Code initiative was proposed to have incremental document delivery by each Sprint (see `VxWorks Doc as Code Guideline <./VxWorksDocAsCode_SG.html>`__)
  - VxWorks 7 BSP related documentation updates (xxx_readme.md & BSP Supplement)  follow this process: `VxWorks BSP Documentation Update Process (from SR0610) <https://jive.windriver.com/docs/DOC-75523>`__
 
- Regardless of what process the team chooses to follow with their author, the following principles are *strongly recommended*:

  1. Contact InfoDev as soon as possible, once the Feature is known to require documentation
  2. Provide readme updates to the author, frequently and as soon as possible
  3. Review and adapt throughout the feature, do not wait until the end
