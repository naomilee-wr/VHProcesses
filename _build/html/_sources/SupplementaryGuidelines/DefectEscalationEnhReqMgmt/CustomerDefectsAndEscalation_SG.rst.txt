Customer Defects and Escalations Guidelines
=============================================

**THIS PAGE IS CURRENTLY SERVING AS A PLACEHOLDER.  IN PROGRESS for updates.**

**Purpose:** Customer defects are typically given special attention.  They can arise in complex situations and necessitate a more immediate response from developers.  The following document provides some guidelines on when to handle customer related defects and policies around escalations.

**Procedure:**
---------------

Defect Reproduction
++++++++++++++++++++

- New customer defects can sometimes be difficult to reproduce.  Defects, where in-house reproduction is not possible, can be loosely categorized in the following 3 groups:



  1.) Pertinent debug information has been provided which clearly points at an issue in WR code

  - Might be fixed through source code analysis and the fix can be validated by the customer
  
  2.) The defect can be reproduced but can only be observed on specific boards

  - E.g.  boards that are only available to the customer

  3.) The defect is not well described and/or cannot be reproduced

  - A developer's help is required to track down the root cause of an issue

- In situations #1 and #2, the Engineering Team should seek to resolve the customer problem.
  
  - It is acceptable to require and request access to customer hardware in order to resolve defects (that cannot be reproduced in-house)

- In situation #3, there is no obligation for the Engineering Team to resolve the customer problem
  
  - It is however, desirable for the Engineering Team to assist Customer Support in debugging the problem
 

Escalated Defects
++++++++++++++++++

- Customers may at times escalate a defect in order to accelerate the time to resolution.  Engineering Teams must respond to Escalation quickly.  The procedures and policies around Escalation are provided by the Customer Support Office(CSO) and are published in the `Worldwide Escalation Process <https://jive.windriver.com/docs/DOC-34980>`__
