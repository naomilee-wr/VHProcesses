====================
Bug Board Policy
====================

|

The purpose of the Bug Board is to review all unresolved Defects (both new and backlog) that may affect customers and establish their Priority, and to respond to exceptions such as shifting priorities and revocation of commitments.

-  The Bugboard must review every unresolved customer defect affecting the target release at least once, and prioritize it. The Bugboard may also review other product affecting defects at their discretion.
-  The Bug Board is the final authority on the Priority of a Defect. The Defect Priority endorsed by the Bug Board may not be modified by a lower authority. For the purpose of endorsing Priority, a quorum is required, consisting of empowered representatives from Engineering, and one other group (e.g., Product Marketing, Field and Customer Support).
-  Actions and decisions of the board must be recorded.
