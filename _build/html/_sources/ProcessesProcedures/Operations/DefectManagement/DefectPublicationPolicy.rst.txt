=============================
Defect Publication Policy
=============================

|

<EPMs to discuss this policy with Dev & CSO>											
#. All defects in released products[1] are to be prepared for publication[2] within 10 days of their acknowledgment[3] or release, whichever occurs later, with the following exceptions:

   -  Publication of the defect could reasonably be expected to expose a customer, partner, or Wind River to unnecessary risk. Included under this exception are defects for which publication would:

      - Expose a problem related to a non-public security alert or other security advisory agency, or
  
      - Compromise pending litigation, or risk legal liability

   -  The quality of the information, or the nature of the defect itself, makes it unsuitable for publication, as determined by the Bug Board[4].

      - **Note**: This exception shall *not* be applied to a *customer-reported* defect.

#. The rationale for not publishing a defect must be recorded in each instance.
#. The following defect record text fields are published.

   - Published Summary
   - Published Description
   - Severity
   - Component/s
   - Fix Version
   - Steps to Reproduce
   - Workaround
   - Host OS
   - Processor Architecture
 
|

**Notes**
~~~~~~~~~~
#. Defects found and fixed in the same release are not published because they never appear in a released product.
#. Customer-reported defects are prepared for publication by the Customer Support Engineer submitting the defect. Defects found by engineering are prepared for publication by the Technical Lead. <Doina to confirm>
#. Defect "Open" state definition: The defect "Open" state infers that the Symptom Details provided constitute a product defect. 

#. Customer Support may request a defect to be published.
