=========================================
Monitoring Defect Metrics Guidelines
=========================================

**Check with with Vx7 Leadership team that this is still a goal**

|


**Purpose**
-----------

Several defect metrics are used by management to assess the state of the product.  These metrics can be accessed by staff to help maintain product quality and prioritize work.

|

**Important Reference**
-----------------------

- Defect Inventory: ??
- Work-On-Hand: ??

|

**Guidelines**
--------------

- The Defect Inventory Dashboard (from Jira) is used to track the rate at which defects get fixed to ensure teams maintain a reasonable sized backlog (relative to efforts)

  - Teams with fewer than 11 weeks of defect inventory are available to develop new features/epics.
  - Teams with more than 11 but fewer than 21 weeks of defect inventory will not be able to develop any new features/epics.
  
    - Features currently under development can be completed
	
  - Teams with more than 20 weeks of defect inventory must explicitly provide a plan on how they will handle their backlog
  
- The Work-On-Hand Dashboard tracks the result of different Jira queries which are indicators of product quality and the effort being put by teams

  - The ultimate goal is to bring all queries as close to 0 as possible
  - Teams should monitor the queries to ensure their domains maintain a minimal footprint
